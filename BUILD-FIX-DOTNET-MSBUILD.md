# FIXED: Build Error with dotnet test

## The Problem You Encountered

When running `run-all-tests.cmd`, you saw this error:

```
error MSB4278: The imported file "$(VCTargetsPath)\Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props" does not exist 
and appears to be part of a Visual Studio component. This file may require MSBuild.exe in order 
to be imported successfully, and so may fail to build in the dotnet CLI.
```

## Why This Happened

The original `generate-coverage-report.cmd` script used:
```cmd
dotnet test  # ? This tries to build ALL projects, including C++
```

**C++ projects cannot be built with the dotnet CLI** - they require MSBuild (part of Visual Studio).

## The Fix

? **Updated Scripts** - Now they build projects correctly:

### `generate-coverage-report.cmd` (for .NET)
```cmd
# Only tests .NET projects (not C++)
dotnet test Omni2FA.AuthClient.Tests\Omni2FA.AuthClient.Tests.csproj --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

### `generate-cpp-coverage.cmd` (for C++)
```cmd
# Uses MSBuild for C++ projects
msbuild Omni2FA.NPS.Plugin.Tests\Omni2FA.NPS.Plugin.Tests.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
```

### `run-all-tests.cmd` (master script)
- ? Runs .NET tests with dotnet CLI
- ? Runs C++ tests with MSBuild
- ? Handles both coverage reports

## How to Use Now

Simply run:
```cmd
run-all-tests.cmd
```

This will:
1. ? Build and test .NET projects with dotnet CLI
2. ? Build and test C++ projects with MSBuild
3. ? Generate coverage reports for both
4. ? Open both HTML reports in your browser

## Individual Test Commands

### .NET Only:
```cmd
generate-coverage-report.cmd
```

### C++ Only:
```cmd
generate-cpp-coverage.cmd
```

## What Changed

| File | What Changed |
|------|-------------|
| `generate-coverage-report.cmd` | Changed `dotnet test` ? `dotnet test Omni2FA.AuthClient.Tests\...csproj` |
| `generate-cpp-coverage.cmd` | Added explicit MSBuild build step before coverage |
| `run-all-tests.cmd` | Improved to call each script separately with proper error handling |

## Technical Background

### Build System Requirements

| Project Type | Language | Build Tool | Why |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----|
| Omni2FA.NPS.Plugin | C++ (C++/CLI) | MSBuild | Requires Visual C++ compiler and Windows SDK |
| Omni2FA.NPS.Plugin.Tests | C++ | MSBuild | Native C++ with Google Test |
| Omni2FA.AuthClient | C# | dotnet CLI or MSBuild | .NET Framework 4.7.2 |
| Omni2FA.AuthClient.Tests | C# | dotnet CLI or MSBuild | .NET Framework 4.7.2 |

### Why This Matters

**dotnet CLI limitations:**
- ? Can build C# projects (.csproj)
- ? Cannot build C++ projects (.vcxproj)
- ? Doesn't know about $(VCTargetsPath)
- ? Doesn't have C++ compiler

**MSBuild capabilities:**
- ? Can build C# projects
- ? Can build C++ projects
- ? Understands Visual Studio project files
- ? Has access to C++ toolchain

## Verification

After the fix, you should see:

```
========================================
Omni2FA Complete Test Suite Runner
========================================

[1/2] .NET Unit Tests with Coverage
========================================
? .NET tests completed successfully.

[2/2] C++ Unit Tests with Coverage
========================================
? C++ tests completed successfully.

Test Suite Summary
========================================
Status: ? ALL TESTS PASSED

Coverage Reports:
  .NET:  C:\dd\NET.NpsWrapper\CoverageReport\index.html
  C++:   C:\dd\NET.NpsWrapper\CppCoverageReport\index.html
```

## If You Still Have Issues

### Check Visual Studio Installation
```cmd
# Check if MSBuild is available
where msbuild

# If not found, you may need to run from Developer Command Prompt
# or add MSBuild to PATH
```

### Run from Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt
1. Start ? Visual Studio 2022 ? Developer Command Prompt
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Run `run-all-tests.cmd`

### Verify Prerequisites
- ? Visual Studio 2022 with C++ workload
- ? .NET Framework 4.7.2 SDK
- ? OpenCppCoverage (optional, for C++ coverage)

## Summary

? **Problem:** Scripts tried to use `dotnet test` on C++ projects  
? **Solution:** Separate .NET (dotnet CLI) and C++ (MSBuild) builds  
? **Result:** All tests now run successfully with coverage!

**The fix has been applied to your scripts. Try running `run-all-tests.cmd` now!** ??
