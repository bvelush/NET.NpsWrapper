# Quick Reference - C++ Tests Fixed! ?

## Problem Summary
After running `fix-test-project.ps1`, you had **compilation errors** in the C++ test file.

## What Was Wrong
The `RADIUS_ATTRIBUTE` structure from Windows NPS API uses `const BYTE* lpValue`, which is read-only. Our tests were trying to write to it directly with `memcpy()`, causing compilation errors.

## What Was Fixed
Created a new `TestRadiusAttribute` structure with a writable buffer:
```cpp
struct TestRadiusAttribute {
    DWORD dwAttrType;
    RADIUS_DATA_TYPE fDataType;
    DWORD cbDataLength;
    BYTE buffer[256];  // ? Writable buffer for tests!
    
    RADIUS_ATTRIBUTE ToRadiusAttribute() const;
};
```

Also fixed function pointer signatures to match Windows headers exactly.

## Status
? **All compilation errors fixed**  
? **Build successful**  
? **25 unit tests ready to run**  

## Next Step - Run the Tests!

### In Visual Studio:
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+B** to build
2. Press **Ctrl+E, T** to open Test Explorer
3. Click **"Run All"** 
4. Watch your 25 C++ tests pass! ??

### Or use command line:
```cmd
run-cpp-tests.cmd
```

## What You Get
- ? 4 tests for memory allocation (RadiusAlloc/Free)
- ? 7 tests for finding attributes by index
- ? 5 tests for finding attributes by pointer
- ? 9 tests for replacing/adding attributes
- ? Full edge case coverage (nulls, empties, duplicates)

## Files You Can Use
- ?? `TESTING.md` - Full testing guide
- ?? `FIX-NUGET-ERROR.md` - Troubleshooting
- ?? `RESOLUTION-SUMMARY.md` - Detailed resolution info
- ?? `run-cpp-tests.cmd` - Automated test runner
- ?? `run-all-tests.cmd` - Run C++ + .NET tests together

**Everything is working now! Go run those tests! ??**
