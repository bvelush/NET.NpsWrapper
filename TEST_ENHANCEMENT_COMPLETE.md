## ?? How to Use

### Generate Coverage Report
```powershell
.\Generate-Coverage-Report.ps1
```

This will:
1. ? Run all tests with coverage collection
2. ? Generate detailed HTML report
3. ? Create coverage badges
4. ? Open report in browser
5. ? Display summary in console

### View Coverage Report
```powershell
# Report automatically opens, or manually open:
Start-Process .\coverage-report\index.html
```

### Run Tests Without Coverage
```powershell
# Quick test run
.\RunAuthClientTests.ps1

# Or directly
dotnet test Omni2FA.AuthClient.Tests\Omni2FA.AuthClient.Tests.csproj
```

## ?? Coverage Breakdown: AuthClient (43.7%)

### What IS Covered ?
- Constructor execution and initialization
- HTTP client setup
- AuthenticateAsync main workflow
- Error handling (timeouts, HTTP errors)
- Input validation (null, empty, special chars)
- Logging method invocations
- Helper methods

### What is NOT Covered ??
- Registry success paths (requires real registry)
- SSL certificate validation (requires SSL errors)
- Basic authentication flow (requires credentials)
- Successful authentication (requires service)
- Polling success scenarios (requires responsive service)
- Some specific exception branches
- Deep event log API interactions

### Why Not 100%?
The uncovered code primarily requires:
1. **Real infrastructure** (registry, services, SSL certs)
2. **Mocked HTTP responses** (not yet implemented)
3. **Active Directory** (for some scenarios)
4. **Specific error conditions** (hard to trigger)

## ?? Visual Coverage Report

The HTML report (`coverage-report/index.html`) provides:

- **Interactive file browser** - Click through your code
- **Line-by-line coloring** - Green (covered), Red (uncovered), Orange (partial)
- **Coverage percentages** - For every class and method
- **Branch coverage details** - See which if/else paths are tested
- **Historical tracking** - Compare coverage over time

**Screenshot Example:**
```
Authenticator.cs                                    43.7%
?? Authenticator()                                  60.0%
?? AuthenticateAsync(string samid)                  40.2%
?? WriteEventLog(LogLevel, string)                  28.5%
?? GetModuleInfo()                                  85.0%
```

## ?? How to Improve Coverage

### To reach 65% (AuthClient)

1. **Mock HTTP Responses** (+15%)
   ```csharp
   // Use Moq to create mock HttpMessageHandler
   // Test successful authentication flow
   // Test different status codes
   ```

2. **Test Registry Scenarios** (+5%)
   ```csharp
   // Mock registry or use test configuration
   // Test SSL bypass
   // Test basic auth setup
   ```

3. **Trigger More Exceptions** (+5%)
   ```csharp
   // Test WebException scenarios
   // Test nested exceptions
   // Test specific HTTP error codes
   ```

### To reach 80% (AuthClient)

4. **Integration Testing** (+10%)
   - Set up test MFA service
   - Test actual authentication flow
   - Test polling mechanism with real responses

5. **Edge Case Coverage** (+5%)
   - Test all logging paths
   - Test all registry combinations
   - Test concurrent scenarios
